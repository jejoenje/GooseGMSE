# GooseGMSE

Goose-GMSE is an interface for a population- and management model for Greenland Barnacle Geese, as described in detail in [SNH Research Report 1039 - Development of a population model tool to predict shooting levels of Greenland barnacle geese on Islay](https://www.nature.scot/snh-research-report-1039-development-population-model-tool-predict-shooting-levels-greenland).

The functions contained in gile goose_predict_gui.R are a direct implementation of the model described in the above.

The app.R file is a Shiny GUI interface which allows repeated (simulated) runs of population trajectories, given selected management inputs.
